# Bookmarks

Bookmarks in the DataGrids package allow users to create named collections of filter sets, sorts, and column visibility/ordering settings. These collections can be saved and reapplied at a later date, providing a convenient way to quickly restore specific data grid configurations. This feature enhances user experience by enabling efficient data management and personalized views.

## How it works

Bookmarks are stored in the database and can be associated with a user or a specific data grid. When a user creates a bookmark, the current state of the data grid (including filters, sorts, and column visibility) is saved as a named collection. Users can then easily switch between different bookmarks to view the data grid in various configurations.
