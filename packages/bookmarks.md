# Bookmarks (Coming Soon)

Bookmarks in the DataGrids package allow users to create named collections of filter sets, sorts, and column visibility settings. These collections can be saved and reapplied at a later date, providing a convenient way to quickly restore specific data grid configurations. This feature enhances user experience by enabling efficient data management and personalized views.
